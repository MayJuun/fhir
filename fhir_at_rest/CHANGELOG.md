## [0.2.1]

* Removed dart:io dependency to allow native compatibility (need pub points dammit!)

## [0.2.0]

* Simplified still further
* Now with same dstu2/stu3/r4/r5 folder setup as most other packages
* single class called FhirRequest that does all of the work (it is a freezed Union)
* added FHIRÂ® to the Readme - official permission from HL7 and Graham Grieve.
* changing most formats from 'application/fhir+json' to just 'json' for querying, it should still be 'application/fhir+json' in the headers
* Fixed it so that not all requests are delete requests. Thanks to [bobosette](https://github.com/bobosette) for [pointing out this issue](https://github.com/fhir-fli/fhir_at_rest/issues/6) to me.

## [0.1.1]

* Lots of changes, mostly taking away complexity
* All parameters and elements are just passed as strings, or maps, so most of the formatting is left up to whoever is designing the call
* All of the previously made searchParameters classes have been deleted. I think they added extra complexity without enough benefit.
* Type passed is dynamic, but should be a ResourceType enum (from any version)
* Returns map value that needs to be changed into a Resource (but this way it will accept any FHIR version)

## [0.1.0]

* Mostly updated to be able to use the most recent FHIR package
* All published packages defined their own enum for resourceType, so I consolidated them, and they're now a part of the base package
* So removed all resourcType enums from this package
* Edited tests and requests
* Removed ability to specify all resourceTypes, partly because it's not in the main package, and partly because it's rare when you should actually be able to access all resources apart from initial designing, building and testing. I'll think about adding that back in later.
* ToDo: consider adding ability to get all resourceTypes

## [0.0.10]

* Changed makeRequest to allow more flexible transactions. Some servers don't like ```headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/fhir+json';``` And when that's the case, we automatically change it to ```headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json';```. Although we weren't doing it properly before. Now we are.

## [0.0.9]

* Updated dependencies, primarily FHIR

## [0.0.8]

* Changed transaction from ```GET``` request to ```POST``` request

## [0.0.7]

* Add support for POST and formData on SearchRequest and OperationRequest classes with the `usePost` and `useFormData` flags.
* Update to `fhir: 0.0.11`
* Add parameter encoding for all parameters including general, interaction specific, search, and custom parameters
* Add http client override to support testing and allow direct management of the client
* Add full support for trial use conditional interaction modes

## [0.0.5]

* Big thanks to [drcdev](https://github.com/drcdev) he's done all of the work for this most recent update which has brought some great changes and added functionality
