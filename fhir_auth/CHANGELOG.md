# fhir_auth

## [0.9.5]

* Updated dependencies

## [0.9.2]

* Updated dependencies

## [0.9.1]

* Updated GcpFhirClient to have access to email & displayName

## [0.9.0]

* Cannot create resources and then find them in Epic. Can create them but due to a CORS issue canot get the location, and identifiers are stripped away upon creation. Ayone who figures this out, please let me know.
* Cerner patient launch works internally and externally
* NOTE: for some reason the Cerner launch does not accept the launch token for an internal launch being attached to the Authorization url - if you need this included, you'll have to adjust how the url is created

## [0.9.0-2]

* Successfully does external and internal web launches to Epic for patients and for users, although for Epic you do need to ensure that you include the proper launch parameters if you're doing a patient context
* Updated dependencies
* Internal launch for patients and users for Epic and Meld (HAPI)
* External launch for patients and users for Google, Meld (HAPI), and Epic
* Cannot read id (location) with resources created in Epic (CORS issue), so you may need to include an identifier

## [0.9.0-1]

* Successfully does external and internal web launches to Epic for patients
* For users, successfully logs in externally, doesn't return all needed headers

## [0.8.1]

* Added demos
    1. External Web demos - aidbox, google, hapi, meld, epic
    2. Internal EHR demos (all web) - meld & epic
    3. External Mobile demos - aidbox, google, hapi, meld
* Updated to new granular SMART scopes (not in use yet, usually)
* Added system, in addition to patient & user scopes
* Had to add new authorizationCodeGrant (extended from Oauth2) to save some of the passed FHIR values
* Added epic client class for values it may pass at launch

## [0.8.0]

* Updated Dependencies
* Fhir 0.8.0
* Flutter 3.0.0
* All Clients are now extensions of http.Client, so they can be passed to fhir_at_rest, and so all requests have been removed from fhir_auth for easier maintenance
* Moved All demos to demo folder
* Same client for each FHIR version, as the only difference for authentication is getting the endpoints
* For web, you will need to include a version of the redirect.html that is included in the lib directory

* Imports sorted

* ClientId is optional for Google Mobile
* EHR Launch example without ClientID (passed as URL argument) to make it more flexible

## [0.5.0-7]

* Simplified ehrlaunchdemo to more closely mirror actual ehr launch workflow
* Added new clinical scopes to correspond to SMART on FHIR 2.0 (note that while these are an option for the enum Interaction, they're not supported yet - baby steps people)

* They are fully supported in Web client NOT in mobile client (again, for now)

## [0.5.0-6]

* initialize() has been changed back to login()
* logout() has been added
* All restful calls now require a FhirClient

## [0.5.0-4]

## [0.5.0-3]

* Fairly big changes this time around
* Changed to use [oauth2_client](https://pub.dev/packages/oauth2_client) instead of [flutter_appauth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth) because it gives me less issues with web (and I can use it for both the mobile client and the web client)
* Updated the readme with much longer instructions
* Authenticates against GCP, MELD, Interopland and Aidbox (haven't checked Azure with this new update)

## [0.3.0-nullsafety.7]

* So Close.
* Normal auth for mobile with no significant changes since last prerelease
* Web auth now available! This is a big change, mostly because I've added it. Should work very similarly to mobile auth though, and I've tried to generally keep the structure of the classes the same.
* authdemo is the example for mobile
* example is the example for web
