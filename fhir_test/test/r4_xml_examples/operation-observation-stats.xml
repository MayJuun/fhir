        <p>The Statistics operation performs a set of statistical calculations on a set of clinical measurements such as a blood pressure as stored on the server.  This operation evaluates 
          <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resources having valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes. Observations with a status of 'entered-in-error' will be excluded from the calculations.
        </p>

        <p>The set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters:</p>

        <ul>

        </ul>

        <p>If successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the input parameters 
          <code>patient</code>,
          <code>code</code> and 
          <code>duration</code> parameters. If unsuccessful, an 
          <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> with an error message will be returned.
        </p>

        <p>The client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server's discretion if count &gt; limit. This functionality is included with the intent of supporting graphical presentation</p>

        <p>This operation cannot be performed on observations that the user is not authorized to see.  It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

(IQR = Q3-Q1) Quartile deviation or Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and the third quartiles.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-1** (&quot;1st Quintile&quot;): The lowest of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-2** (&quot;2nd Quintile&quot;): The second of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-3** (&quot;3rd Quintile&quot;): The third of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-4** (&quot;4th Quintile&quot;): The fourth of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.&#xD;&#xA; - **skew** (&quot;Skew&quot;): Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness).&#xD;&#xA; - **kurtosis** (&quot;Kurtosis&quot;): Kurtosis  is a measure of the &quot;tailedness&quot; of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.   Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis).&#xD;&#xA; - **regression** (&quot;Regression&quot;): Linear regression is an approach for modeling two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression)  This Statistic code will return both a gradient and an intercept value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xD;If successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.&#xD;&#xD;The client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server's discretion if count &gt; limit. This functionality is included with the intent of supporting graphical presentation"/>

  <comment value="If [modifier extensions](extensibility.html#modifierExtension) are present in the Observation, they must be accounted for by implementers.  A modifier extension may affect the observation.value in a way that it should be excluded from the from the calculations.&#xD;&#xD;This operation cannot be performed on observations that the user is not authorized to see.  It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one. If there is no nominated patient (e.g. the operation is invoked at the system level) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, then the server should return an error. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification."/>
