    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following scenario is based on existing
      jurisdictional policy and are realized in existing systems in Canada. The default policy is
      one of implied consent for the provision of care, so these scenarios all deal with withdrawal
      or withholding consent for that purpose. In other jurisdictions, where an express consent
      model is used (Opt-In), these would examples would contain the phrase "consent to" rather than
      "withhold" or "withdraw" consent for. <p> specific to use-case 2. Withhold or withdraw consent
        for disclosure of a specific record (e.g. Lab Order/Result) </p><p> Patient "P. van de
        Heuvel" Primary Care Provider, Dr. Philip Primary, has ordered a set of lab test which Adam
        wishes to keep as private as possible. At the sample collection facility, he indicates that
        he would like withhold consent to disclose the order and all results associated with that
        specific order from all other providers </p>
