      jurisdictional policy and are realized in existing systems in Canada. The default policy is
      one of implied consent for the provision of care, so these scenarios all deal with withdrawal
      or withholding consent for that purpose. In other jurisdictions, where an express consent
      model is used (Opt-In), these would examples would contain the phrase "consent to" rather than
      "withhold" or "withdraw" consent for. <p> specific to use-case 3) Withhold or withdraw consent
        for disclosure to a specific provider organization </p><p> Patient "P. van de Heuvel"
