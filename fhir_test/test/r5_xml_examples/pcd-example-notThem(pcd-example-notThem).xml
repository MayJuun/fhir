    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following scenario is based on existing
      jurisdictional policy and are realized in existing systems in Canada. The default policy is
      one of implied consent for the provision of care, so these scenarios all deal with withdrawal
      or withholding consent for that purpose. In other jurisdictions, where an express consent
      model is used (Opt-In), these would examples would contain the phrase "consent to" rather than
      "withhold" or "withdraw" consent for. <p> specific to use-case 4) Withhold or withdraw consent
        for disclosure to a specific provider agent (an individual within an organization) </p><p>
        Patient "P. van de Heuvel" ex-spouse, Bill T Lookafter is a Nurse that is employed by Good
        Health Hospital. P. realizes that she may receive treatment at GHH, however she does not
        want her ex-spouse to have any access to her IIHI. She indicates that she would like to
        withdraw/withhold consent to disclose any instance of her health information to her
        ex-spouse as a result of his employment at Good Health Clinic. </p>
