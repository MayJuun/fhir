For example: a psychotherapy episode may contain highly sensitive information, while the metadata may simply indicate that some episode happened. The confidentiality codes can carry multiple vocabulary items. HL7 has developed an understanding of security and privacy tags that might be desirable in a Document Sharing environment, called HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS).
