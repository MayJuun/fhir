The Prenatal Trio Whole Exome Sequencing (Prenatal Trio WES) test is ordered by a physician and must be accompanied with a consent form and detailed clinical information. In general, the test is used when prenatal imaging detects an anomaly that strongly suggests that there is an underlying genetic etiology. Prenatal Trio WES is often considered only after fetal chromosome microarray analysis has been non-diagnostic.","analysis":[{"identifier":[{"use":"temp","system":"http://www.somesystemabc.net/identifiers/genomicAnalyses","value":"urn:uuid:1111-1111-1111-1112"}],"instantiatesUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33927380/","title":"Maternal Sequence Variation Detection Using Next Generation Sequencing","subject":{"reference":"Patient/mother"},"specimen":[{"reference":"Specimen/specimenMother"}],"date":"2022-07-01T01:01:10-06:00","note":[{"text":"This is a next generation sequencing analysis of a mother of a proband."}],"performer":[{"actor":{"reference":"Practitioner/practitioner02"},"role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-v3-ParticipationType.html","code":"PRF","display":"Performer"}]}}],"device":[{"device":{"reference":"Device/NGS-device"}}]},{"identifier":[{"use":"temp","system":"http://www.somesystemabc.net/identifiers/genomicAnalyses","value":"urn:uuid:1111-1111-1111-1113"}],"instantiatesUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33927380/","title":"Paternal Sequence Variation Detection Using Next Generation Sequencing","subject":{"reference":"Patient/father"},"specimen":[{"reference":"Specimen/specimenFather"}],"date":"2022-07-01T01:01:10-06:00","note":[{"text":"This is a next generation sequencing analysis of a father of a proband."}],"performer":[{"actor":{"reference":"Practitioner/practitioner02"},"role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-v3-ParticipationType.html","code":"PRF","display":"Performer"}]}}],"device":[{"device":{"reference":"Device/NGS-device"}}]},{"identifier":[{"use":"temp","system":"http://www.somesystemabc.net/identifiers/genomicAnalyses","value":"urn:uuid:1111-1111-1111-1114"}],"instantiatesUri":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6885382/","title":"De Novo Mutation Detection and Interpretation","subject":{"reference":"Patient/proband"},"date":"2022-07-01T03:01:10-06:00","note":[{"text":"This is a next generation sequencing analysis of the comparison analysis of proband and parents sequences."}],"input":[{"file":{"reference":"DocumentReference/genomicFileProband"},"type":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/genomicstudy-dataformat","code":"bam","display":"BAM"}]}},{"file":{"reference":"DocumentReference/genomicFileMother"},"type":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/genomicstudy-dataformat","code":"bam","display":"BAM"}]}},{"file":{"reference":"DocumentReference/genomicFileFather"},"type":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/genomicstudy-dataformat","code":"bam","display":"BAM"}]}}],"output":[{"file":{"reference":"DocumentReference/genomicFileGroupAsSubject"},"type":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/genomicstudy-dataformat","code":"vcf","display":"VCF"}]}}],"performer":[{"actor":{"reference":"Practitioner/practitioner02"},"role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-v3-ParticipationType.html","code":"PRF","display":"Performer"}]}}],"device":[{"device":{"reference":"Device/Triodenovo-SW"}}]}]}
