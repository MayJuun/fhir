Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself). There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","type":"display","linkId":"ingredient-questionnaire.json.0.17.3.0"}]},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1}],"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.code","text":"Substance as a 'specified substance', implying extra substance related characteristics","type":"group","required":true,"repeats":false,"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control","code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over"}]}}],"text":"Substance as a 'specified substance', implying extra substance related characteristics.","type":"display","linkId":"ingredient-questionnaire.json.0.17.4.0"}]},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"CodeableConcept"}],"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.group","text":"The group of specified substance, e.g. group 1 to 4, where the group categorises the level of \ndescription of the substance according to standardised sets of properties","type":"group","required":true,"repeats":true,"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control","code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over"}]}}],"text":"The group of specified substance, e.g. group 1 to 4, where the group categorises the level of \ndescription of the substance according to standardised sets of properties.","type":"display","linkId":"ingredient-questionnaire.json.0.17.5.0"},{"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.group.coding","text":"code:","type":"open-choice","required":false,"repeats":false},{"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.group.text","text":"text:","type":"string","required":false,"repeats":false}]},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"CodeableConcept"}],"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.confidentiality","text":"Confidentiality level of the specified substance as the ingredient","type":"group","required":false,"repeats":true,"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control","code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over"}]}}],"text":"Confidentiality level of the specified substance as the ingredient.","type":"display","linkId":"ingredient-questionnaire.json.0.17.6.0"},{"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.confidentiality.coding","text":"code:","type":"open-choice","required":false,"repeats":false},{"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.confidentiality.text","text":"text:","type":"string","required":false,"repeats":false}]},{"linkId":"Ingredient.specifiedSubstance.strength","text":"Quantity of the substance or specified substance present in the manufactured item or pharmaceutical product","type":"group","required":false,"repeats":true,"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control","code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over"}]}}],"text":"Quantity of the substance or specified substance present in the manufactured item or pharmaceutical product.","type":"display","linkId":"ingredient-questionnaire.json.0.17.7.0"}]}]}]}],"meta":{"tag":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActReason","code":"HTEST","display":"test health data"}]}}
