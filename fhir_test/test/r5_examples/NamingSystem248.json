There are three kinds of codes in this code system:\n * Qualifier codes: SHALL/SHOULD/MAY\n * Functional codes - these describe a functional behavior applications may implement, and have the concept property qualify \u003d true, and must be qualified by one of SHALL, SHOULD, or MAY\n * Composite codes - these specialise AggregateConcepts, and have an concept property \u0027expression\u0027 that defines them in terms of a set of functional codes\n \n Functional and Qualifier codes are combined using the syntax ```[modifierCode] \":\" [obligationCode]``` e.g. SHALL:will-send\n \n The functional codes are grouped into three different high level categories:\n * ResourceProducerObligations - functions that pertain to applications that produce resources (typically from databases or forms)\n * ExchangerObligations - functions that pertain to applications that transfer resources between other applications (including FHIR repositories)\n * ResourceConsumerObligations - functions that pertain to applications that consume the content of resources and do something with them\n \n Note that applications typically produce and consume resources, whether client, server or something else again, and \n many applications transfer resources as well\n ","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm","code":"001","display":"World"}]}],"uniqueId":[{"type":"uri","value":"http://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem/obligation","preferred":true}]}
