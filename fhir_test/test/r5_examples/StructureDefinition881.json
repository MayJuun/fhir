For this reason, the mustSupport flag is never set to true by the FHIR specification itself - it is only set to true in profiles.  A profile on a type can always make mustSupport \u003d true if it is false in the base type but cannot make mustSupport \u003d false if it is true in the base type.   This is done in [Resource Profiles](profiling.html#mustsupport), where the profile labels an element as mustSupport\u003dtrue. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear exactly what kind of \"support\" is required, as this can mean many things.    Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a \"key\" element (e.g. one of the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.","requirements":"Allows a profile to set expectations for system capabilities beyond merely respecting cardinality constraints.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"ElementDefinition.mustSupport","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"meaningWhenMissing":"In a base type, where the element is being defined for the first time, the element is assumed to be mustSupport \u003d false.
