  /// [Encounter]: An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s)
  /// for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health
  ///  status of a patient.
  ///
  /// [resourceType]: This is a Encounter resource
  ///
  /// [id]: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource.
  ///  Once assigned, this value never changes.
  ///
  /// [meta]: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is
  /// maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always
  ///  be associated with version changes to the resource.
  ///
  /// [implicitRules]: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the
  /// resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the
  /// content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that
  ///  defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
  ///
  /// [implicitRulesElement]: Extensions for implicitRules
  ///
  /// [language]: The base language in which the resource is written.
  ///
  /// [languageElement]: Extensions for language
  ///
  /// [text]: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource
  /// and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The
  /// narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to
  /// contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just
  /// read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be
  ///  represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
  ///
  /// [contained]: These resources do not have an independent existence apart
  /// from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified
  /// independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction
  ///  scope.
  ///
  /// [extension]: May be used to represent additional information that is not
  /// part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of
  /// extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance
  /// applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer
  /// can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met
  ///  as part of the definition of the extension.
  ///
  /// [modifierExtension]: May be used to represent additional information that
  /// is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the
  /// understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of
  /// the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide
  /// negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and
  /// manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition
  /// and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an
  /// extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the
  /// definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are
  ///  required to check for modifier extensions.
  /// Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on
  /// Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of
  ///  modifierExtension itself).
  ///
  /// [identifier]: Identifier(s) by which this encounter is known.
  ///
  /// [status]: planned | arrived | triaged | in-progress | onleave | finished |
  ///  cancelled +.
  ///
  /// [statusElement]: Extensions for status
  ///
  /// [statusHistory]: The status history permits the encounter resource to
  /// contain the status history without needing to read through the historical
  ///  versions of the resource, or even have the server store them.
  ///
  /// [class]: Concepts representing classification of patient encounter such as
  /// ambulatory (outpatient), inpatient, emergency, home health or others due
  ///  to local variations.
  ///
  /// [classHistory]: The class history permits the tracking of the encounters
  /// transitions without needing to go  through the resource history.  This
  /// would be used for a case where an admission starts of as an emergency
  /// encounter, then transitions into an inpatient scenario. Doing this and not
  /// restarting a new encounter ensures that any lab/diagnostic results can
  /// more easily follow the patient and not require re-processing and not get
  ///  lost or cancelled during a kind of discharge from emergency to inpatient.
  ///
  /// [type]: Specific type of encounter (e.g. e-mail consultation, surgical
  ///  day-care, skilled nursing, rehabilitation).
  ///
  /// [serviceType]: Broad categorization of the service that is to be provided
  ///  (e.g. cardiology).
  ///
  /// [priority]: Indicates the urgency of the encounter.
  ///
  /// [subject]: The patient or group present at the encounter.
  ///
  /// [episodeOfCare]: Where a specific encounter should be classified as a part
  /// of a specific episode(s) of care this field should be used. This
  /// association can facilitate grouping of related encounters together for a
  /// specific purpose, such as government reporting, issue tracking,
  /// association via a common problem.  The association is recorded on the
  /// encounter as these are typically created after the episode of care and
  /// grouped on entry rather than editing the episode of care to append another
  ///  encounter to it (the episode of care could span years).
  ///
  /// [basedOn]: The request this encounter satisfies (e.g. incoming referral or
  ///  procedure request).
  ///
  /// [participant]: The list of people responsible for providing the service.
  ///
  /// [appointment]: The appointment that scheduled this encounter.
  ///
  /// [period]: The start and end time of the encounter.
  ///
  /// [length]: Quantity of time the encounter lasted. This excludes the time
  ///  during leaves of absence.
  ///
  /// [reasonCode]: Reason the encounter takes place, expressed as a code. For
  ///  admissions, this can be used for a coded admission diagnosis.
  ///
  /// [reasonReference]: Reason the encounter takes place, expressed as a code.
  ///  For admissions, this can be used for a coded admission diagnosis.
  ///
  /// [diagnosis]: The list of diagnosis relevant to this encounter.
  ///
  /// [account]: The set of accounts that may be used for billing for this
  ///  Encounter.
  ///
  /// [hospitalization]: Details about the admission to a healthcare service.
  ///
  /// [location]: List of locations where  the patient has been during this
  ///  encounter.
  ///
  /// [serviceProvider]: The organization that is primarily responsible for this
  /// Encounter's services. This MAY be the same as the organization on the
  /// Patient record, however it could be different, such as if the actor
  /// performing the services was from an external organization (which may be
  /// billed seperately) for an external consultation.  Refer to the example
  ///  bundle showing an abbreviated set of Encounters for a colonoscopy.
  ///
  /// [partOf]: Another Encounter of which this encounter is a part of
  ///  (administratively or in time).
